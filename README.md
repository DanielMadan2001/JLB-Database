# JLB-Database
**A baseball league database system created using Node.js, EJS, HTML and Javascript!**

Through this website, you can view all aspects of the current season's teams and each player's individual information. Players can be found in the master list or searched by their name or team. By clicking on a player in the list, you can view their unique baseball card, which is filled with information they had previously submitted to the league. Any new entrants can be added to the list, which will allow the user to manually input the data of a new player.

How to run:
1. Download the ZIP file and extract the contents into a new folder.
2. Through Command Prompt, locate the folder's location (for many computers: _>cd Downloads_ will change the directory to the local Downloads folder, which likely contains the project)
3. Run the Node.js file using _>node index.js_.
