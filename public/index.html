        <h1> Welcome to the Junior League Baseball Database!</h1>
        <p> 
            Through this website, you can view all aspects of the current season's teams and each player's individual information.
            Players can be found in the master list or searched by their name or team using the first two buttons above.
            By clicking on a player in the list, you can view their unique baseball card, which is filled with information they had previously submitted to the league.
            Any new entrants can be added to the list by using the third button above, which will allow the user to manually input the data of a new player.
